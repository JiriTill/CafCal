      <h2>Coffee Dosage Calculator: daily caffeine intake, safe limits & mg per cup</h2>
      <p className="prose">
        Looking for a simple <strong>coffee dosage calculator</strong> that translates science into everyday guidance?
        This page helps you estimate a <strong>safe daily caffeine intake</strong>, convert it into <strong>cups of coffee</strong>,
        and pick a <strong>last-cup time</strong> that protects your sleep. Choose your region (EU/US/Canada), switch between
        <strong> kg and lbs</strong>, and compare drinks (brewed coffee, espresso, instant, cold brew, energy drinks).
      </p>
      <p className="prose">
        For healthy adults, most authorities set a ceiling around <strong>400&nbsp;mg caffeine per day</strong>, while pregnancy
        guidance is typically <strong>≤200&nbsp;mg/day</strong>. Our calculator converts these limits into
        real-world choices: how many espressos, how many 8-oz cups, or how to split doses across the day.
        If you’re training, you’ll also see a <strong>performance range</strong> (3–6&nbsp;mg/kg) with the reminder to stay
        under your daily cap. Teens and children? We display a clear warning and point you to our guide on
        <a href="/blog/caffeine-and-kids"> caffeine & kids</a>.
